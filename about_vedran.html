				<h1 class="h1-heading">About me</h1>
					<p>I am a designer with over 10 years’ experience, focusing on user experience design, usability and interface design.</p>
					<p>I am currently working as a Senior UX Designer at <a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href="https://seek.com.au">SEEK</a>.</p>

					<h2 class="h2-heading">Technical beginnings</h2>

					<p>After graduating from Engineering (robotics) and Computer Science in 2004, I started my career as a System Design Engineer working on automated cancer diagnostics instruments. I developed a passion for observing how people interact with the machines, systems and software that I designed.</p>

			<div class="sub-section__content">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">A turning point</h2>

					<p>A career shaping event was an opportunity to spend two years working in the UK and across Europe, studying how medical staff use cancer diagnostic instruments, how our engineers service those instruments and helping both groups improve their processes.</p>

					<p>That was in 2007. That passion for observing how people interact with products and using those observations to design better experiences, lives on in me and is the key reason why I love what I do.</p>

			<div class="sub-section__content">
					<h2 class="h2-heading">My focus today</h2>

					<p>The evolution of my design process and the process of the teams I work with, is a major interest of mine. I am focused on experimenting with, and continuously improving these processes.</p>

					<p>I am a big advocate for the use of modern design tools, collaborative design practices and early and continued involvement of users in the design process.</p>

					<p>I love pushing pixels, it suits my detail-oriented side. I can lose myself in Sketch for hours, but I never lose sight of the bigger picture, the audience I’m designing for and the business whose objectives I’m helping meet.</p>

					<p>Sharing knowledge, with people I work with and across the design community, is something I’m passionate about. To this end, I have started a<a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href=https://www.meetup.com/Sarajevo-UX-Design/> UX design meetup group</a>, presented at <a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/vedranio/presentations">other meetup groups</a> and actively <a class ="link link--on-light-bg link--inline" target="_blank" href="http://medium.com/@vedranio">write</a> about design.</p>
